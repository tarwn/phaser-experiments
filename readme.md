# How to run
_Future Eli, you are welcome_

This project has a number of things built-in:
* eslint: a mix of recommended and reasonable rules, autofix is on by default in vscode via settings
* typescript: 3.8.3+
* npm because I'm lazy
* editorconfig because vscode will autofix to standard stuff if you have the extension
* wallaby (Ctrl+R, R) for realtime test runner
* jest for tests
* phaser as the base engine

Want to run everything?
* `npm run start`

Just ____?
* terrain: `cd terrain & npm run start`
